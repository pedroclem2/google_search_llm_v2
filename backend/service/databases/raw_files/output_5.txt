My wife is raising the bar and cooking some Beef Wellington for Valentine's
Day and since I've never had it, I'm at a loss for what wine to pair. With the
pasty shell and other goodies packed inside, in addition to a Cab Sauv, I was
thinking maybe a Rhone varietal...CdP, Tablas Panoplie, FM Reserve Syrah??? I
think a secondary stage would be good. I also have been saving a '01 Barolo
for a great meal, but I am also not very familiar with them so I don't if that
would work. TN's for it note a cherry flavor, which makes me think it may not
be the best. I'm open to any suggestions and would greatly appreciate any
thoughts. _(I searched the forum and while the dish appears, I couldn't find
any pairing suggestions.)_

old left bank BDX. Do you have any '82 Mouton around?

We've made one for several Christmas's in a row.  
  
If you have it, I recommend 90's Bordeaux or Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. I've
done a '92 Silver Oak and a '94 Opus One that were phenomenal, as well as a
'95 Clerc Milon.  
  
With the Mushrooms I'd also think you could go aged Barolo pretty easily as
well.

Coincidentally we are having this tomorrow as well (very 80's!)  
  
I agree, old Bordeaux can't go wrong....I've decided on '95 Lynch-Bages for
ours..

A 1998 St Henri I think would work a treat also.. just by chance you have one

Pastry tends to dull the palate.  
We've experimented with this a number of times; I prefer a younger wines with
some zip. A couple of years ago we tried it with a lineup of '89 and '90
Bordeaux, all first growths or super seconds. The wines fell flat. I would not
serve Beef Wellington with a treasured bottle.  
BIG +1 on Scott H's Barolo suggestion.

I tend to go more with S1 on this. With plain meat (seared/charred steak) the
char provides an accent that to me goes well with smoother wines like older
Bdx. Beef Wellington is mellower than steak without much "bite" and is by
formal recipe with chicken livers (or duck) and mushrooms quite rich. Smooth
and Rich! So I want a younger wine that will have ZIP ans S1 said. I want some
acidity to cut the richness and provide contrast.  
  
For Bdx I would want something on the early side of its drinking window which
of course depends on the Chateau so I tend to shy away from specific years.
Some of my 2010 St. Emilion would be nice as would my 2005 Haut Medoc. Had a
2005 Beaulieu George Latour Reserve last week that I would say would go well
so I would think 2005 Cali CS would fit well. But there are lots of other
wines that would work well also. I think I would go Bdx for the elegance which
would pair well with the elegance of Beef Wellington.

Thank you to all for your suggestions!!! Unfortunately, my cellar doesn't have
any GC's from the 80's (or any year for that matter), so I tried to match up
my cellar with other suggestions. After considering the TN's on those, I've
reduced it to an '05 Heitz CS, '05 Stag's Leap Fay Vnyd CS, '01 Podero Aldo
Conterno Riserva, and an '05 Beychevelle. While I'm okay with parting with my
last bottle of the Napa CS's, since I only have 2 each of the Barolo and Bdx,
after reading the TN's I'm leaning towards letting 'em rest. Since my cellar
is more shallow than deep, this conflict seems to alway arise.

I served beef wellington for Christmas and paired a 2011 Saxum Bone Rock JBV
followed by a 2009 Rasa Syrah Principia Reserve. Thought it was a good pair.
First time for me to make beef wellington and it came out beautiful and was
delish!

So, I went with an '05 Heitz Cab Sauv and unfortunately, was not wowed by it.
It seemed to be a bit overpowered by the great flavors of the Wellington. I
had an inexpensive Spanish wine on deck for after dinner and I decided to try
it in alongside the Heitz and a part of me enjoyed it a more. It had a more
body and a stronger flavor profile to stand up to the dish. On a do-over,
maybe I'd go with a younger Heitz...maybe 5 y.o.

Sorry the Heitz didn't wow you. I find that a lot of wines are good young *or*
old, but not so much in their middle age. The Heitz could be in that middle
phase now. If you have more, I'd suggest setting them aside for awhile to see
what develops
