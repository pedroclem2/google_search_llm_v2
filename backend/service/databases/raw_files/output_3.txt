#  Rookie needs help pairing with beef wellington for Xmas Eve

Wine dunce here and I'm hosting Christmas eve for a small group and need your
help! The menu is Beef Wellington (Gordon Ramsay's recipe - mushrooms,
chestnuts & prosciutto around a tenderloin with a pastry crust), mashed Yukon
gold spuds, some garlic shrimp, and some more veggies. This year is the first
year hosting that I was able to afford something a little special, so went
pretty huge on the tenderloin and would love a rock star pairing of wine withe
the Wellington ($20/bottle is the budget). Can anyone help me hit this meal
out of the park? My family and I would be forever grateful! Happy Holidays!

EDIT: Received a bottle of 2010 Stags Leap CabSav as a gift today at work -
would this pair well or should I save it for a rainy day??
