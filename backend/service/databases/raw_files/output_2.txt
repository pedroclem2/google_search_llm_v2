##  The best wine pairings with Beef Wellington

Posted by Fiona Beckett (Google+) on December 3 2021 at 07:30

Beef Wellington is real treat and deserves an equally indulgent red wine to
pair with it It is however less robustly flavoured than a steak or rib roast
of beef with other key ingredients such as mushrooms and pastry which offset
the flavour of the meat. For me that tends to indicate pinot rather than
cabernet but take your pick. Here are my suggested wine pairings

#### Good red burgundy and other pinot noir

Fillet steak - the cut that's most commonly used for a Wellington - pairs
particularly well with pinot noir - and that's only improved by the mushroom
duxelles (finely chopped mushrooms) in the filling. Think the best **red
burgundy** you can afford with some bottle age (a 2017 vintage at the time of
updating this entry in late 2023). A **Chambolle-Musigny** or **Vosne-Roman
ee** would be perfect if you can run to it. Top new world pinot from
California, Oregon and New Zealand would also be great

For other great pinot noir pairings see here

#### Saint-Emilion, Pomerol and other merlot-dominated Bordeaux

Also a top match though I'd suggest the right bank rather than the left - in
other words merlot dominated wines such as **Saint-Emilion** and **Pomerol** ,
again at least 2-3 years old. Other good quality merlot from e.g. California
would hit the spot too

Which other foods match well with merlot

#### Cote Rotie (and aged shiraz)

In general I think syrah/shiraz is a bit powerful for a Wellington but Cote
Rotie from the northern Rhone has a finesse that would show both the dish and
the wine off well. And I wouldn't complain at a bottle of Grange or Hill of
Grace!

Syrah also goes with these dishes.

Barolo

Beef Wellington isn't a classic Italian dish but Barolo would be an excellent
wine accompaniment.

**Note** : _if you 're going for a top wine, particularly a delicate one go
easy on the accompanying vegetables. Really buttery mash and maybe a few
garlicky green beans or even peas would be perfect. Strongly flavoured veg
like red cabbage would take it in another direction._

_Similarly keep the sauce relatively light rather than dark, sticky and
concentrated for these pairings_
