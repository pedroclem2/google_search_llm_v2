## Description

Beef Wellington is a beef filet covered with a paté made of mushrooms, onions,
and herbs, and then baked wrapped in a pastry.

Beef Wellington should be paired with a medium bodied red wine that goes well
with both the beef and the mushroom and herbs.

Pinot Noir is an excellent choice, if you are in the mood for a lighter red.
